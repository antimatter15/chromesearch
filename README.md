Chrome Desktop Search
=====================

This is a search engine for local files made for Chrome. It's a proof of concept more than anything else. It's possible because of several new features in Chrome 6.0. The ability to access file:/// URLs is a big one. It uses the Infobars API for messages. The Omnibox is used as the main search interface.

###How to use

1. First, you need to navigate to a file:/// URL through Chrome and press the infobar button to crawl it. This depends on the operating system.
2. Now, you just have to type stuff in the omnibox to search. Prefix your queries with "fs " and observe the magic
